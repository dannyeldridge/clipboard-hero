# ClipboardHero for macOS

A native macOS clipboard manager built with Swift and SwiftUI.

## Features

- Monitors clipboard and maintains history
- Menu bar access for quick clipboard item selection
- Search through clipboard history
- Native macOS app (no Electron)
- Supports text, URLs, and file paths
- Persistent history between app launches

## Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode 14+ or Swift 5.9+ command line tools

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd clipboard-new
   ```

2. Build and create the app bundle:
   ```bash
   ./build-app.sh
   ```

3. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   open ClipboardHero.app
   ```

The app will appear as a menu bar icon and runs continuously in the background to monitor clipboard changes.

## Alternative Build Methods

### Using Swift Package Manager directly:
```bash
cd ClipboardHero
swift build -c release
.build/release/ClipboardHero
```

### Using Xcode:
1. Open the `ClipboardHero` folder in Xcode
2. Build and run the project

## Development

### For development work:
```bash
cd ClipboardHero
swift run                # Debug mode
swift run -c release     # Release mode
```

### Generate Xcode project for debugging:
```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
# Then open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode
```

## Architecture

- **ClipboardMonitor**: Core service that polls NSPasteboard for changes
- **ClipboardItem**: Data model for clipboard entries
- **SwiftUI Views**: Modern UI for both main window and menu bar
- **UserDefaults**: Persistent storage for clipboard history

## Next Steps

- Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Shift+V)
- Support for images
- Preferences window
- App icon design
